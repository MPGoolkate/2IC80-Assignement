# Installation
Make sure to install the python packages needed by the attack. This can be done with `pip install [package]`. 

# Running
To run the program you should start up a chrome debugging window, make sure all other chrome windows on your machine are closed. 
Then execute the command `chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222`. Within this tab navigate to [mail.google.com](https://mail.google.com/).  

Now the attacker can insert the desired text in the victims mail.
